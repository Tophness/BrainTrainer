I've had this for ages and I keep giving less and less fucks about re-uploading my files to my website every time new servers I try out lose all my shit,
So I thought this would be a good reason to start putting my shit on github.

U press left or right depending on which way the spiral is "spinning" (it's actually animated gifs that loop linearly or alternate colours across RGB to look like they're spinning).
The frequency that it changes between them is static. I think I made it generated by pi or something I can't remember.
I used to use this to guage how well Neuro Programmer (amazing program, check it out) was improving my brain's performance with certain things.

This version I think was a slightly bugged one where I improved lots of things but made the last level physically impossible because it can't even take the input fast enough.

Feel free to hack the shit out of it.
I'm sowwy I don't comment anything I code.. I doen got time for dat sheit I know I'm terrible :(
I can't even work out what half my shit does myself but w/e yolo.
